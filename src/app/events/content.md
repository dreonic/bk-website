  Each year, Balik Kampoeng brings together Indonesian students from NTU to
  return home and make a difference in local communities across Indonesia.
  Through our past events, we've carried out initiatives that focus on
  education, environment and community empowerment, aimed at uplifting those in
  need.


  These moments remind us of the impact we can create when we work with heart, purpose, and unity. Take a look at some of our past projects and the stories behind them!
