    Balik Kampoeng (BK) is a student-led volunteering organisation and the
    humanitarian arm of the Indonesian Students’ Association at NTU. Established
    in 2011, we are dedicated to giving back to local communities in Indonesia
    through service, learning, and cultural exchange.


    Balik Kampoeng literally means “returning to the village,” reflecting our mission to work hand in hand with rural communities to create meaningful and sustainable impact, even while we are miles away in Singapore.
