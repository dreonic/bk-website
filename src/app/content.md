  Balik Kampoeng (BK) is a student-led volunteering organisation and the
  humanitarian arm of the Indonesian Students' Association at NTU. Established
  in 2011, we are dedicated to giving back to local communities in Indonesia
  through service, learning, and cultural exchange.


  Balik Kampoeng literally means "returning to the village," reflecting our mission to work hand in hand with rural communities to create meaningful and sustainable impact, even while we are miles away in Singapore.

whyWeExistTitle: Why do we exist?
whyWeExistDescription: BK exists because we believe that caring for others
  shouldn’t stop just because we’re studying abroad. We want to make a
  difference in underprivileged communities in Indonesia, through empathy,
  action, and meaningful connections. Every project we do comes from the heart.
