faq:
  - question: Who can volunteer with BK?
    answer: "Anyone from the NTU’s Indonesian community (current students, exchange
      students, or alumni) who is passionate about community impact. "
  - question: Do I need prior volunteering experience?
    answer: Nope. First-timers are encouraged and everyone is welcome here!
  - question: Where do activities take place?
    answer: "Our #BeloemBK events are held mostly in Singapore. For our annual D-Day
      project, we travel to various regions in Indonesia. Specific details will
      be shared for each activity."
  - question: Is the D-Day trip funded?
    answer: Unfortunately no, the trip is not funded. Volunteers will need to cover
      their own expenses (e.g., flights, accommodation, and daily needs).
      However, we will provide estimated cost breakdowns and recommendations to
      help you plan your budget.
  - question: How can I donate?
    answer: "Look out for our #KabarBK posts for in-kind needs (books, supplies,
      expertise). Donation details will be shared per campaign."
  - question: Who do I contact for questions?
    answer: DM Instagram (@balikkampoeng), email (bk.balikkampoeng@gmail.com) or DM
      linkedIn (Balik Kampoeng).
